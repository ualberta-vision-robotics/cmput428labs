## Overview

In this lab you'll learn about 2D projective geometry and homography estimation.


__Important: You can obtain 2 bonus marks for each section you finish and demo while present during the lab period we introduce the lab.__

## 1. Homogeneous Transforms and Projections (30)
The following code loads the point cloud [happy.npy]({{"/assets/labs/happy.npy" | relative_url}}){:target="_blank"} and displays it in a 2d scatterplot. Use these points to complete question 1.

[happy.txt]({{"/assets/labs/happy.txt" | relative_url}}){:target="_blank"} is also available if you prefer.

```python
with open('happy.npy', 'rb') as f:
    happy_face = np.load(f, allow_pickle=True)

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot()
plt.scatter(happy_face[0], happy_face[1], color='gray')
ax.set_aspect('equal', 'box')
plt.title("my face when I learn new things")
plt.show()
```

### a) 3D Homogeneous Transformations
1. Rotate
2. Translate
3. Create a facade of 3 point clouds

**Deliverables:**
- Lorem Ipsum

**Report Question 1a:** Lorem Ipsum?

### b) Projections
1. Apply orthographic projection to the three objects in a)
2. Apply Perspective projection to the three objects in a)


**Deliverables:**
- Lorem Ipsum

**Report Question 1a:** Lorem Ipsum?

## 2. Estimating Focal Length (10)
- Determine the focal length of your phone camera by using it to take a picture of a ruler a known depth away.
- Make sure the ruler is placed perpendicular to the camera axis (i.e. the ruler is square to the camera).
- Use similar triangles formed with the ruler and its projection in the image to find the focal length.
- See [page 68 of these slides](https://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~vis/courses/CompVis/lectures18/lec06GeomIntro.pdf).

**Deliverables:**
- Write the focal length as a comment in your code

**Report Question 2** What is the focal length of your phone camera? How does this compare to the manufacturers' specifications?

---
## 3. 2-image Stereo Reconstruction (25)
- Place a camera perpendicular to a ruler pointed at an object
- Move the camera sideways a known distance, measured by the ruler, and take a second picture.
- Select features that characterize the structure (i.e. the corners of a cube) in both images.
- Determine the depth of the feature points using corresponding points in the two images.
- Use the depth to reconstruct the 3D coordinates of the points in a camera-centred coordinate system.
- Plot the points in a 3d plot.

**Deliverables:**
- Save the plot of the reconstructed object and the two images you took to include with your submission.
- Place the plot of the reconstructed object and the two images you took into your report.

**Report Question 2** Would our reconstruction still work if the translation is not perpendicular to the camera axis?

## 4. n-image Stereo Reconstruction (35)
### a) Synthetic Data
- Build a 3D representation of a box object
- Project the structure on a set of `n=10` images along a line perpendicular to the camera axis at a fixed interval. Perform a perspective projection with a camera that has the focal length determined in Question 2.
- Formulate the least squares system for determining the depth of the feature points using all `n` images.
- Reconstruct the 3D coordinates and compare the results with the starting structure
- See [page 12-14 of these slides](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse455/09wi/Lects/lect16.pdf).

**Deliverables:**
- Save the plot of the reconstructed object and one example projection to include with your submission.
- Place the plot of the reconstructed object and one example projection into your report.

### b) Bonus (10) - Real Data
- Record a video of a moving object (or camera) on a line perpendicular to the camera axis and 
  - Sliding your object/camera against a fixed surface can improve recordings.
- Use trackers to track a set of feature points that characterize the structure.
- Formulate the least squares system for determining the depth of the feature points using all `n` images.
- Reconstruct the 3D coordinates and compare the results with the starting structure

**Deliverables:**
- Save the plot of the reconstructed object and the recording to include with your submission.
- Place the plot of the reconstructed object and one frame of the recording into your report.
