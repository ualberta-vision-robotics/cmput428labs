## Overview

In this lab you'll learn about 3D projective geometry and stereo reconstruction.


__Important: You can obtain 2 bonus marks for each section you finish and demo while present during the lab period we introduce the lab.__

## 1. Homogeneous Transforms and Projections (30)


A transformatrion matrix, $$M$$, can be used to transform 3D points in homogeneous form:

\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{l}
\displaylines{x'\\\ y'\\\ z'\\\w'}
\end{array}\right)
=
M
\left(\begin{array}{l}
\displaylines{x\\\ y\\\ z\\\1}
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}

We define translation and rotation matricies in homogenenous coordinates as follows:


\begin{equation}
T=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\displaylines{
1 & 0 & 0 & t_x\\\ 
0 & 1 & 0 & t_y\\\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & t_z\\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
R = R_zR_yR_x
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
R_z=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\displaylines{
cos\theta & sin\theta & 0 & 0\\\ 
-sin\theta & cos\theta & 0 & 0\\\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
R_y=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\displaylines{
cos\theta & 0 & -sin\theta & 0\\\ 
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\ 
sin\theta & 0 & cos\theta & 0\\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
R_x=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\displaylines{
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\ 
0 & cos\theta & sin\theta & 0\\\ 
0 & -sin\theta & cos\theta & 0\\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
S=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\displaylines{
s_x & 0 & 0 & 0\\\ 
0 & s_y & 0 & 0\\\ 
0 & 0 & s_z & 0\\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}


### a) Generating 3D Point Clouds

<div class="row justify-content-md-center">
    <div class="col-sm-10 mt-6 mt-md-6">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/point_cloud.png" title="point clouds" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Uniformly sampled points used to create point clouds.
</div>

The following code block creates a line with randomly sampled points from $$X~U(0,1)$$.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

numpoints = 50
t = np.random.rand(1, numpoints)
zeros = np.zeros((1, numpoints))
ones = np.ones((1, numpoints))

x_l = t
y_l = zeros
z_l = zeros
line = np.row_stack((x_l, y_l, z_l, ones))
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(projection='3d')
ax.set_box_aspect([1,1,1])
ax.scatter(x_l, y_l, zeros, 'gray')
plt.title("x line point cloud")
```
- Recreate the plots above featuring a line, a circle, and a cube.

**Deliverables:**
- Display your figure in your report.
- Save your figure to include in your submission.

**Report Question 1a:** What type of projection is being used to render these point clouds on our screen?

### b) 3D Homogeneous Transformations
- Create functions that return the 3D transformation matrices defined above. Use them to apply the following transformations on your cube point cloud:
1. A rotation about at least two axes.
2. A translation and a scaling.

**Deliverables:**
- Display figures of your transformed cubes in your report.
- Save figures of your transformed cubes to include with your submission.

**Report Question 1b:** Why do rotations also translate the cube?

### c) Projections
1. Apply orthographic projection to the two transformed cube point clouds you created in b)
2. Apply perspective projection to the two transformed cube point clouds you created in b)

**Deliverables:**
- Display your four projections in your report.
- Save your four projections to include with your submission.

**Report Question 1c:** Name two differences between orthographic projection and perspective projection.

## 2. Estimating Focal Length (10)
- Determine the focal length of your phone camera by using it to take a picture of a ruler a known depth away.
- Make sure the ruler is placed perpendicular to the camera axis (i.e. the ruler is square to the camera).
- Use similar triangles formed with the ruler and its projection in the image to find the focal length.
- See [page 68 of these slides](https://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~vis/courses/CompVis/lectures18/lec06GeomIntro.pdf).

**Deliverables:**
- Write the focal length as a comment in your code

**Report Question 2** What is the focal length of your phone camera? How does this compare to the manufacturers' specifications?

---
## 3. 2-image Stereo Reconstruction (25)
- Place a camera perpendicular to a ruler pointed at an object
- Move the camera sideways a known distance, measured by the ruler, and take a second picture.
- Select features that characterize the structure (i.e. the corners of a cube) in both images.
- Determine the depth of the feature points using corresponding points in the two images.
- Use the depth to reconstruct the 3D coordinates of the points in a camera-centred coordinate system.
- Plot the points in a 3d plot.

**Deliverables:**
- Save the plot of the reconstructed object and the two images you took to include with your submission.
- Place the plot of the reconstructed object and the two images you took into your report.

**Report Question 3** Would our reconstruction still work if the translation is not perpendicular to the camera axis?

---
## 4. n-image Stereo Reconstruction (35)
### a) Synthetic Data
- Build a 3D representation of a box object
- Project the structure on a set of `n=10` images along a line perpendicular to the camera axis at a fixed interval. Perform a perspective projection with a camera that has the focal length determined in Question 2.
- Formulate the least squares system for determining the depth of the feature points using all `n` images.
- Reconstruct the 3D coordinates and compare the results with the starting structure
- See [page 12-14 of these slides](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse455/09wi/Lects/lect16.pdf).

**Deliverables:**
- Save the plot of the reconstructed object and one example projection to include with your submission.
- Place the plot of the reconstructed object and one example projection into your report.

**Report Question 4a** How does the reconstruction process differ as we increase the number of images in our dataset?

### b) Bonus (10) - Real Data
- Record a video of a moving object (or camera) on a line perpendicular to the camera axis and 
  - Sliding your object/camera against a fixed surface can improve recordings.
- Use trackers to track a set of feature points that characterize the structure.
- Formulate the least squares system for determining the depth of the feature points using all `n` images.
- Reconstruct the 3D coordinates and compare the results with the starting structure

**Deliverables:**
- Save the plot of the reconstructed object and the recording to include with your submission.
- Place the plot of the reconstructed object and one frame of the recording into your report.
