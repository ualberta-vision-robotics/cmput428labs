## Overview

In this lab, you'll implement a basic 2-DoF optical flow algorithm. These flow vectors describe the motion in a scene. Equation 1 is the basis of optical flow. We can capture the temporal shift between two frames by using a first order approximation:

\begin{equation}
-I_t=\nabla I^T\mathbf{u}
\end{equation}

where $$I_t$$ is the temporal image gradient, and $$I_x$$ and $$I_y$$ are the spatial image gradients. For each image in our sequence, we want to find its temporal and spatial gradients and solve for $$\mathbf{u}$$.

This [zip file]({{"/assets/labs/sample_videos.zip" | relative_url}}){:target="_blank"} contains the sample videos you can use to complete this lab. However, you are encouraged to capture your own and evaluate which videos perform well and which perform poorly.

## 0. Capturing Images with OpenCV

The following code grabs frames from a camera and displays them in a new window:

```python
import cv2
cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0, cv2.CAP_FIREWIRE) # Remove second arg if using webcam
while True:
    ret_val, img = cam.read()
    cv2.imshow('test', img)
```

Modify this code to use `imwrite` to save a sequence of images we will use for this lab.

## 1. Single Window Optical Flow (20)

Complete the following steps for one timestep:

### a) Temporal Image Gradient
- Convert a sequenced pair of images to grayscale.
- Find the temporal difference between the two images.
- Threshold the temporal derivative by setting values that do not meet our threshold to zero.
- Test different threshold values until motion is isolated and noise is minimized.

**Deliverables:**
- Display the final thresholded temporal derivative in your report.

**Report Question 1a:** What does the temporal image gradient tell us about our image pair?

### b) Spatial Image Gradient
- Write a function that finds the spatial image gradients, $$I_x$$ and $$I_y$$, along the first and zeroth axes of our image, respectively. Compute an approximation of $$I_x$$ and $$I_y$$ using the definition of a gradient. Avoid using `numpy.gradient` for this exercise.

**Deliverables:**
- Display these results in your report.

**Report Question 1b:**
- What features are prominent in each spatial gradient?
- **Bonus (5)** Include examples of images with prominent features and images without prominent features. How does this affect things like the condition number of the image and subsequently the quality of the computed \(u\)?

### c) Solve for $$\mathbf{u}=[u,v]^T$$
- Plot $$\mathbf{u}$$ onto the center of our image using `matplotlib.pyplot.quiver`.

**Deliverables:**
- Display these results in your report.

## 2. Single Window Optical Flow Video (20)

### a) Compute the single window optical flow steps on one of the provided videos or collect your own.

**Deliverables:**
- Save these results to include in your submission.

**Report Question 2:** What is one limitation of finding a single optical flow vector on the entire window?

---

## 3. Optical Flow on Patches (20)

Complete the following steps for one timestep:

### a) Divide Gradients into Patches
- Divide your gradients into patches of size `block_size x block_size`.

**Report Question 3:** How does changing `block_size` affect your results? What are some benefits and drawbacks of increasing `block_size`?

### b) Find Flow Vectors for Each Patch
- For each patch, find the flow vectors $$u$$ and $$v$$.

### c) Plotting
- For each tile, plot the motion vector $$\mathbf{u}$$ onto the center of the tile using `matplotlib.pyplot.quiver`.

**Deliverables:**
- Display these results in your report.

## 4. Optical Flow Video (20)

### a) Capture two videos that are ideal for your optical flow algorithm
- Write a function that applies the optical flow algorithm to videos/image sequences. Record your own videos captured from any camera to use with your function.

**Deliverables:**
- Save these results to include in your submission. Please put them in a folder `tracking/good`. Ensure each video is less than 10 mb.
- Briefly discuss what qualities made these videos ideal in your report.

### b) Capture two videos that are the worst case for your optical flow algorithm
- Apply your optical flow function to video/image sequences that you recorded. These can be captured from a physical camera; however, one can be artificially generated.

**Deliverables:**
- Save these results to include in your submission. Please put them in a folder `tracking/bad`. Ensure each video is less than 10 mb.
- Briefly discuss what qualities caused poor performance in your report.

**Report Question 4:** What sort of motion have we captured here? Name two types of motion we cannot account for with our current method.

## 5. Rotation and Scale (20)

### a) Rotation and Scale Gradients
- Write a function to find rotation and scale gradients $$I_r$$ and $$I_s$$ for a single image.

**Deliverables:**
- Display these results in your report.

### b) Solve Motion Vectors for Rotation and Scale
- Write a function to solve for motion vectors $$r$$ and $$s$$ using a formulation similar to Equation 1 in a single window (i.e., no tiles) of a video with rotation and zoom with respect to the camera axis.
- Plot your results by mapping the x-vector to rotation and the y-vector to scale.

**Deliverables:**
- Save these results to include in your submission.
- **Bonus (5)** Include examples of images with prominent features and images without prominent features. How do these differ from the prominent features you found in $$I_x$$ and $$I_y$$?

---

## 6. Linear Taylor Approximation

**Bonus (5)** How accurate is your linear assumption? What features make the assumption better or worse? What would an image pair look like if H.O.T. was truly 0? Generate an image pair where H.O.T. is 0.
