## 1. 2-Dof Tracker (50)

Create a function that takes a pair of sequenced images and a tracking region and returns the updated tracking region.

### a) Create a live implementation using your tracker function.

**Deliverables:**
- Display a pair of images with bounding box overlaid in your report.

**Report Question 1a:** lorem ipsum?

### b) Capture one video that results in ideal performance for your tracker.
- Apply your tracker to a moving object in the video.

**Deliverables:**
- Save the video with bounding boxes to include in your submission. Please put it in a folder `media/good`. Ensure the video is less than 10 mb.
