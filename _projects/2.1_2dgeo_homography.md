## 1. Homogeneous Transforms (20)
A transformatrion matrix, $$M$$, can be used to transform 2D points in homogeneous form:

\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{l}
\displaylines{x'\\\ y'\\\ w}
\end{array}\right)
=
M
\left(\begin{array}{l}
\displaylines{x\\\ y\\\ 1}
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}

We define translation, rotation, scale and shear matricies in homogenenous coordinates as follows:

\begin{equation}
T=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\displaylines{
1 & 0 & t_x\\\ 
0 & 1 & t_y\\\ 
0 & 0 & 1
}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
R=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\displaylines{
cos\theta & -sin\theta & 0\\\ 
sin\theta & cos\theta & 0\\\ 
0 & 0 & 1
}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
S=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\displaylines{
s_x & 0 & 0\\\ 
0 & s_y & 0\\\ 
0 & 0 & 1
}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Sh=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\displaylines{
1 & sh_x & 0\\\ 
sh_y & 1 & 0\\\ 
0 & 0 & 1
}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

These matrices transform the homogeneous points with respect to the coordinate origin. They can be multiplied in any order and order of multiplication determines the order of the transformations performed on the points. For further reading, see Chapter 2.4 of Hartley and Zisserman.

The following code loads the point cloud [house.npy]({{"/assets/labs/house.npy" | relative_url}}){:target="_blank"} and displays it in a 2d scatterplot. Use these points to complete Question 1. You must add the homogeneous coordinate row yourself.

[house.txt]({{"/assets/labs/house.txt" | relative_url}}){:target="_blank"} is also available if you prefer. Use `np.loadtxt()` with `delimiter=','` to load it.

```python
with open('happy.npy', 'rb') as f:
    house = np.load(f, allow_pickle=True)

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot()
plt.scatter(house[0], house[1], color='gray')
ax.set_aspect('equal', 'box')
plt.title("House")
plt.show()
```

</div>

- Create functions that create translation, rotation, scale and shear transformation matricies using the equations provided above. Apply the following transformations to our provided house point cloud and recreate the above figure. 
  1. Original Point Cloud.
  2. Translate by (100, -50).
  3. Rotate by +90 degrees.
  4. Rotate by -90 degrees about centroid.

    _, image = cv2.threshold(image,0,255,cv2.THRESH_BINARY+cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
    y, x = np.nonzero(image == 0)
    x = np.array(x.T)
    y = np.array(-y.T) + dimy

plt.show()
```

- Use the above function to generate point clouds of your own assets. Search up coloring page versions of your favorite characters and load them in.
- Create a composite image of your own using the transformations you've learned. Load in at least two assets and transform them to create a scene.
- Note: Large images can create tens of thousands of points. Use scale to reduce the number of points if it hampers performance.

**Deliverables:**
- Display the image in your report.
- Save your image to include with your submission.

**Report Question 1c:** Describe how you created this image and the transformations you used.

## 2. 2D Projective Geometry: Points, lines and their incidence (20)

### a) Hand Drawing

The homogeneous equation of a line is given as follows:
\begin{equation}
l^Tx=ax+by+c=0
\end{equation}
It holds true for all points that lie on the line.

The following three homogeneous lines display a simplified diagram of a railway track and the horizon.

$$
l_1=\left(\begin{array}{c}
-100 \\
1 \\
1
\end{array}\right) 
\quad l_2=\left(\begin{array}{c}
100 \\
1 \\
100
\end{array}\right) \quad l_H=\left(\begin{array}{c}
0 \\
1 \\
-100
\end{array}\right)
$$

Sketch the drawing labelling all three lines and the position of the vanishing point, the intersection of $$l_1$$ and $$l_2$$, given by $$l_1\times l_2$$.

**Deliverables:**
- Display the sketch in your report (you may use software to draw this sketch or scan a hand sketch).
- Save the sketch to include with your submission.

### b) Construct the midpoint and midline of the football field in the image below.

<div class="row justify-content-md-center">

1.  Click on the corners of the field using `matplotlib.pyplot.ginput` or your own mouse callback.
2.  Convert the points to homogeneous coordinates.
3.  Compute the diagonal lines $$l_1$$ and $$l_2$$ (the line between two points is $$l=p_1\times p_2$$).
4.  Compute the midpoint, $$p_m$$ using the diagonal lines (the intersection between two lines is $$p=l_1\times l_2$$).
5.  Compute the vanishing point, $$p_\infty$$ as the intersection of the two short sides of the field.
6.  Compute the midline using the vanishing point and the mid-point.

**Deliverables:**

## 3. Robot Visual Servoing Task Specifications (20)

### a) Line-to-line constraint

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/parl_1.png" title="Line to Line 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/parl_2.png" title="Line to Line 2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Line to line constraint for robot visual servoing.
</div>

\begin{equation}
e_{l2l} = y_1 \cdot (y_3 \times y_4) + y_2 \cdot (y_3 \times y_4)
\end{equation}

- Record a video of two books - rotate and move one of the books while leaving the other still.
- Track the appropriate points to construct the line to line constraint.
- Overlay the value of the constraint and the points/lines we are tracking onto the video.
- Optional: normalize the points and lines before computing the constraints to avoid overly large numbers.

**Deliverables:**
- Save the video with overlaid features to include with your submission.
- Display one frame of your video in your report.

**Report Question 3a:** What happens to the value of our constraint when we bring one line to the other?

### b) Parallel lines constraint

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/l2l_1.png" title="Parallel lines 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/l2l_2.png" title="Parallel lines 2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Parallel lines constraint for robot visual servoing.
</div>
The equation for the line to line constraint is:

\begin{equation}
e_{par} = (l_1 \times l_2) \times (l_3 \times l_4)
\end{equation}


- Use the same video but repeat with the parallel lines constraint.
- This time our constraint is vector valued. Overlay the constraint and the points/lines we are tracking onto the video and verify that its magnitude decreases when the books are near parallel, and its sign changes when the books cross the point of being parallel.

**Deliverables:**
- Save the video with overlaid features to include with your submission.
- Display one frame of your video in your report.

</div>

- See page 39-49 of [these slides](https://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~vis/courses/CompVis/lectures18/lec06ProjG2D.pdf)

### a) Basic DLT Function
- Write a function `get_homography(x_1, x_2, normalization=False)` that returns the homography matrix, `H`, between two images, given the 4 (or more) point correspondences, `x_1` and `x_2` between two images.
- Apply your transformation to the first image to verify your results.
- Get the point correspondences through clicking on the same four features in two different images.

**Deliverables:**
- Display the two original images and the transformed image in your report.

**Report Question 4a:** What could be one real life use of this process?

### b) Normalization
- Implement a normalization procedure into your algorithm. Translate the points such that their mean is centred at the origin. Scale the points such that the average euclidean distance to the origin is $$\sqrt 2$$.
- Explore performance of your algorithm with your own pictures.

**Deliverables:**
- Using your own images, display the two originals and the transformed image in your report.


**Report Question 4b**
- After the homography is applied, do the overlapping areas in the two images look exactly the same? Why or why not?
- Correspondences are not always perfect. What happens if some of the correspondences are incorrect? How can this be handled?

<!-- - This method is being used to align two images of a planar surface. Can it be used to align images of non-planar objects? What conditions need to be met?
- What if we only have four or more corresponding pairs of lines, instead of points? Or some pairs of points and some pairs of lines? Will the algorithm still work (under obvious modifications)? -->
