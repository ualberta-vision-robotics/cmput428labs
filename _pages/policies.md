- Lab sessions will be used to introduce lab assignments, help for lab assignments, and assignment demos.

- Discussion and questions are encouraged to go to the eclass forum.

<!-- - Late submissions will be accepted at a 20% penalty per day. -->

- Office hours are by appointment via email.

- Demos and report submissions occur at the end of each topic. Sign up sheets will be released closer to demo dates.

- Demos will be short informal presentations of your code. Questions will be asked to evaluate your understanding.

- Sharing video and images are allowed but submissions are expected to be your own work only.
