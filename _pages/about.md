Welcome to the lab website for CMPUT 428/615. Here you'll find the resources you'll need to complete the lab assignments for this course.

The labs are separated into 3 topics: 
<ol>
  <li>Motion estimation and tracking</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <a href= '{{ '/opticalflow' | relative_url }}'>Lab 1.1 - Optical Flow</a>
    </li>
    <a href= '{{ '/tracking' | relative_url }}'>Lab 1.2 - Tracking</a>
  </ul>
  <li>Projective Geometry and Stereo</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <a href= '{{ '/2dgeometry' | relative_url }}'>Lab 2.1 - 2D Projective Geometry and Homography Estimation</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href= '{{ '/3dgeometry' | relative_url }}'>Lab 2.2 - 3D Projective Geometry and Stereo Reconstruction</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Structure from Motion</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
     <a href= '{{ '/structurefrommotion' | relative_url }}'>Lab 3 - Structure from Motion</a>
     </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
You will be given one week to complete each lab assignment (e.g. Lab 1.1). Following the completion of each topic, you will submit a report and demo your code in the next lab session.
Reports are to include answers to the written response questions in each lab assignment, as well as any results we ask for.<br>
<strong><font color ='DarkViolet'>For grad students, we will include additional items to address in violet font.</font></strong>
<br>
See the <a href='https://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~vis/courses/CompVis/calendar.htm' target="_self">calendar</a> for submission deadlines. <!--We also encourage you to join the course <a href='https://discord.gg/jjkNU8SGwP'>discord</a> for discussion and assistance.-->
